# Reprogramming-GMUX-On-2011-Macbook-Pro-After-Discrete-GPU-Failure
We flash and we see things.... 

This video is the process I followed after experiencing a critical failure in the discrete GPU inside my 2011 Macbook Pro in the middle of a certification class. Needless to say, it was a bad time to have my computer fail. I was typing notes when my display went crazy and locked into random pattern of colors and shapes that made no sense, but I knew that the laptop was indeed posting and successfully loading the OS. Not willing to accept that it was a lost cause, I went down the rabbit hole of seeing if I could repair it myself. 

The repair is performed in a production environment at my employer after hours where I needed a bench to work on. My coworkers have a presence in the video and are also, let's say, silly throughout. The tone is playful and light, with some silly jokes and memes that I included for fun after the fact to show them what was included in the video. As I can't control my fellow co-workers behavior, I hope you will allow some room for extra sights and sounds you won't typically find in a YouTube video. ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‰ I hope you find it an enjoyable and educational 26 minutes to learn how to revive a Macbook Pro suffering from this issue.
